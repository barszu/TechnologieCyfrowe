# Digital Techniques

The exercises aim to familiarize with digital/electronic circuits.

For exercises 2 and 3, we used our implementation of the McCluskey method.

## Exercise 1: Four-bit natural number to six-bit prime number transcoder

- Objective: Transcode a four-bit natural number to a six-bit prime number.
- Gates used: NAND.
- Transforming numbers from 0 to 15 into prime numbers.
- Carnaught tables.

## Exercise 2: TIMER

- Objective: Design a four-bit TIMER circuit.
- Setting the time using switches.
- Flip-flops and logic gates used.
- Counting down from the set time when the START button is pressed.
- Visual alarm with an LED after the counter reaches zero.
- Displaying the current time on seven-segment displays.
- Decimal 2\*7 segment displayer.
